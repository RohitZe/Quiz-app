## Issue with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

The API endpoint provided (`https://api.jsonserve.com/Uw5CrX`) is hosted on a different domain, and when directly called from the frontend, it leads to a **CORS issue**. This issue occurs because the browser restricts making requests to a different domain for security reasons.

### **Solution**

To resolve this issue, a simple **Express server** is set up in the backend. The server fetches the quiz data from the external API and sends it to the frontend, thereby bypassing the CORS restrictions.

### **Steps to Set Up and Run the Project**

#### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RohitZe/Quiz-app.git
cd Tesline-quiz-app 
```
### **Step 2: Set up the server**
1. Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```
2. Install the required dependencies for the backend:

```bash
npm install or npm i
```
3. Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```
The Express server will run on `http://localhost:8000`. It fetches the quiz data from the remote API and forwards it to the frontend.

### **Step 3: Set up the Frontend**
1. Navigate back to the root folder:

```bash
cd ..
```
2. Navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```
3. Install the required dependencies for the frontend:

```bash
npm install
```
4. Start the React development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
The React app will run on `http://localhost:5173` and will fetch the quiz data from your backend server.

### **Step 4: Access the Application**
Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to interact with the quiz application.

## **Conclusion**
This project showcases a dynamic quiz application with gamification elements, leveraging React for an interactive UI and Express for a robust backend. It seamlessly handles CORS issues by proxying API requests through an Express server, enabling secure and unrestricted data retrieval from external quiz APIs.
